# Scala_Language_in_GitHub
With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists.  Scala is also an open source project. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories -- who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc. -- are publicly available.  We're going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

To run the notebook, first install the dependencies with:
